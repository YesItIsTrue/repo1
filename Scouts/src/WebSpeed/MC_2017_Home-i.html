            This is our second year of Man College!!! This year we will study the ways of the Master Builders (and we don't mean Emmett).
            We will tap into the creative power that is our heritage from the Creator of the Universe.  We will find within ourselves the 
            resources to make things happen, not just let them happen.  We will prepare ourselves as we prepare for the Second Coming of 
            the Savior.  We will not sit idly by and wonder who will fashion the brave new world that we will live in.  We will be the Men 
            who raise a Zion to our God.  We are Builders in Zion!
       </P>

            We welcome you Young Men and Leaders to Man College!!!  We celebrate your decision to join with us as we take time to develop 
            skills that will serve us temporally even as we enhance the skills that will serve us spiritually. We will be strengthened by 
            one another.  We will rejoice together.  We will uplift one another.  We are holders of the Priesthood of God, we carry the 
            hope and promise of a better way to all of mankind, and we will be the Builders of Zion!
        </P>
