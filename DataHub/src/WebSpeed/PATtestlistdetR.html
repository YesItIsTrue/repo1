        Version 
        1.0 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 28/Oct/14.  Original Version.
        1.1 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 09/Jan/15.  Linked to the TKtestresR.html.
        1.2 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 11/Jul/15.  Modified hyperlink results
                to work with changes to TKtestresR.html.  Continuing to pass older
                HTML variables to it because I think that it has a problem.  Also 
                added Lab Sample ID & Lab Seq to the display.  Marked by 1dot2.
        1.21 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 13/Jan/15.  Slight bug that has been in 
                there for a while.  It was only showing TK_sequence = 1 for some
                unknown reason.  Also added in the CSS grid stuff.  Marked by 121. 
        1.3 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 05/Oct/15.  Added in some visual components 
                that were missing.  Marked by 1dot3.               
        1.31 - Written by Jacob Luttrell on 12/Jan/16.  Added Lab Processed (Lab Completed)
                to the displayed table. Marked by 1dot31  
        1.32 - Written by Jacob Luttrell on 04/Mar/16. Updated testtype to test_type (unmarked).    
        1.4  - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 24/Mar/16.  Fixed problem with whattorun.  Marked by 1dot4.
        1.41 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 25/May/16.  Changed the sorting to make more sense.  Marked by 141.
        1.5  - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 28/May/16.  Edited to have it pull more precise data 
                from the trh_hist.  Marked by 1dot5.
        1.51 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 01/Jun/16.  Needed to look at the new(ish) trh_date field
                instead of the trh_create_date.  Marked by 151.
