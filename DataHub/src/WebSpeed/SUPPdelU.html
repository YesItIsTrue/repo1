 *  SUPPdelU.html   -   Version 1.1
 *
 *  This program is designed to provide basic maintenance for the Supplements that could
 *  be recommended on a testkit (MPA or BioMed).  It is not intended to update which tests
 *  have those supplements as recommendations on them, only that they exist to be chosen 
 *  from.  Updates the suppl_list table in the HHI database.
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Revision History:
 *  -----------------
 *  1.0 - written by Doug Luttrell on 06/Oct/14.  Original Version.
 *  1.1 - written by DOUG LUTTRELL on 19/Nov/14.  Updated to sort by name instead of ID
 *          now that I've loaded the data from the RS database.  This change exists in 
 *          the included form.  Thus, the actual change was there and this just needed 
 *          to be recompiled.  Marked by 1dot1.
 *  1.2 - written by Trae Luttrell on 29/Sep/15/  Putting the grid html commands. 
 *  1.3 - written by Jacob Luttrell on 06/Oct/15 changed 2col to col. Marked by 1dot3.
 *  1.4 - written by Jacob Luttrell on 09/Nov/15.  Added delete function.  Marked by 1dot4.
 *  1.5 - written by Jacob Luttrell on 18/Mar/16. Added this-procedure:file-name. Marked by 1dot5.
